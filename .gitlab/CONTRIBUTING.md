## Pull Request Process

Before creating a pull request:

- **Ensure Your Branch Is Up-to-Date:**  
  Rebase your branch onto the latest `develop` branch to prevent merge conflicts.
- **Follow the Guidelines:**  
  Make sure your changes are well-tested, follow our coding standards, and include relevant documentation if necessary.

- **Reference Issues:**  
  If your PR addresses an existing issue, include `refs #<issue-number>` or `fixes #<issue-number>` in your PR description.

Our maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. We aim to make the review process as smooth and timely as possible.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) standard. Your commit messages should have the following format:

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

- **Types** may include:
  - `feat` – a new feature
  - `fix` – a bug fix
  - `docs` – documentation changes
  - `style` – code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor` – code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `test` – adding or correcting tests
  - `chore` – changes to tooling, build process, etc.
  - `high priority` – a high priority feature or fix
  - `high risk` – a high risk feature or fix
  - `improvement` – an improvement to the codebase

_Examples:_

- `feat(auth): add social login integration`
- `fix(ui): correct misaligned button on homepage`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

Using clear and consistent commit messages makes it easier for everyone to understand the project history and aids in automating changelog generation.
